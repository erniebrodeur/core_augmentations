# CoreAugmentations

A collection of (somewhat) simple additions to the base ruby classes.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'core_augmentations'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install core_augmentations

## Usage

Each method is contained in it's own file.  This allows us to extend only the methods we need as we need them.

`require 'core_augmentations/String/to_human'`

All the methods have spec's, they don't have any documentation.  For now just browse the source directory to see
what is available.
